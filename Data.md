### How Much Data?

From the Chinchilla paper, one can note that the relation between model size and training loss is not correlated but rather associated. For each amount of compute (which translates to amount of training data), 
the training loss shows a convex shaped function, which means that for each amount of compute, there is an optimal model size, below or above which, the training loss will be higher.
